## Lesson 3: Plagiarism and MIT License  
**Popcorn Hack:**  
MIT License is permissive, allows modification and distribution with attribution. For my own repo, I used the MIT License because it offers flexibility for users while protecting my credit. It encourages reuse and collaboration without complex restrictions.

**License Added:**  
[MIT License on GitHub Repo](https://github.com/adik1025/imop_frontend?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#MIT-1-ov-file)

## Lesson 4: Using the IP of Others  
**Popcorn Hack:**  
Creative Commons allows reuse with specific conditions. Exceptions to copyright include fair use and public domain content.

---

## Lesson 5: Copyright  
**Popcorn Hack (Partner: Arjun S.):**  
Avoid infringement by citing sources, checking licenses, using public domain or CC content, understanding fair use, creating original content, using licensed stock media, and asking for permission when unsure.

## Homework Hack: Choosing a License  

### Task 1 & 2: Personal Repo License  
**License Chosen:** MIT License  
**Explanation:** I chose the MIT License for its simplicity and flexibility. It allows others to use and build on my project as long as they credit me. This helps foster open collaboration and keeps the project accessible to others in the community.

### Task 3: Add the License  
Added to personal repo here:  
[MIT License on GitHub](https://github.com/adik1025/imop_frontend?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#MIT-1-ov-file)

### Task 4: Define the Project  
**Project:** IMOP Frontend  
**Description:** A React dashboard for visualizing predictive infrastructure maintenance data using machine learning. Designed to support proactive government decision-making with clear data displays and interactivity.

### Task 5: Add Different License to CPT or Pilot City Project  
A second repo will use a different license (e.g., GPL or Apache 2.0) and include a LICENSE file with updated author and year info.
