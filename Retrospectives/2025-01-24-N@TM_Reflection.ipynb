    "# Night at the Museum: A Reflection on Our CS Showcase\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, our school hosted an incredible event called **Night at the Museum**, where every group in my **Computer Science class** showcased the projects we had been working on throughout the trimester. It was a fantastic opportunity to **share our work, receive feedback, and help others refine their projects**. The energy in the room was palpable, with students and adults engaging with our demos, asking insightful questions, and providing constructive criticism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Role in the Event\n",
    "\n",
    "As someone actively involved in the event, I took on multiple responsibilities, including:\n",
    "- **Presenting my project, Club Hub**, to students, teachers, and visitors.\n",
    "- **Providing guidance and feedback** to other groups on their projects.\n",
    "- **Attending and engaging with other presentations**, learning from their work and methodologies.\n",
    "- **Receiving direct feedback from peers and visitors**, helping us identify areas of improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "I made sure to **document my engagement** throughout the night. Below are some moments from the event:\n",

    "## Our Project: ClubHub\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is ClubHub?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project, **ClubHub**, is a web application designed to **help students discover and manage school clubs efficiently**. It features:\n",
    "- A club directory where students can browse all available clubs.\n",
    "- A personalized club recommendation system based on interests.\n",
    "- A **leadership application system** that allows students to apply for leadership positions.\n",
    "- A **club creation feature**, enabling students to propose new clubs seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Presentation Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "Presenting **Club Hub** was an exciting experience. We demonstrated its core functionalities to different audiences, answering questions about the **technical aspects, user experience, and real-world applications**. Many attendees, including **students and teachers**, saw the potential of ClubHub in streamlining club management and engagement within the school.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feedback and Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Receiving feedback from **both students and adults** was invaluable. Here are some of the most insightful comments we received:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Positive Feedback**\n",
    "- *\"This is really cool, good job on your ClubHub project.\"* - **Neil C**\n",
    "- *\"I really like your styling and how your features are integrated and make sense when used together, especially the leadership application and the create club features. Very innovative.\"* - **Kiruthic**\n",
    "- *\"This website is really cool and has very good applications in the real world since people can use this website to choose what club to join or other things relating to clubs.\"* - **Aaditya**\n",
    "- *\"The idea of this website is actually quite innovative. You can tell the execution went through well, and the idea of clubs in a real-world application itself works very well.\"* - **Armaghan Z.**\n",
    "- *\"The UI design is great! Overall, great project.\"* - **Tarun Rayavarapu**\n",
    "- *\"Great project, very relevant to school students.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Constructive Criticism & Areas for Improvement**\n",
    "- *\"I really like how many options you have, but next time you can make the theme a bit more connected and less choppy with containers.\"* - **Rohan**\n",
    "- *\"This is very cool and relatable as it has a little list showing interests, but just add a theme next time and make it look a little better.\"* - **Arhaan**\n",
    "- *\"This is a very nice-looking website, but the purpose is quite minimal in terms of actually helping people with choosing or managing clubs.\"* - **Nikhil**\n",
    "- *\"I love the red color scheme and how each feature is integrated with each other. I would recommend letting the user be able to add their own interests that are not on the list.\"* - **Aadi**\n",
    "- *\"One thing I think you can improve on is the admin features, making it so the admin can only edit the actual CRUD functions.\"* - **Tarun Rayavarapu**\n",
    "\n",
    "## How I Helped Other Groups\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/fntm1.png\">\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/fntm2.png\">\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/fntm3.png\">\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/fntm4.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## One particular project...\n",
    "\n",
    "As I encountered many projects throughout the course of the event, I found one project in particularly to be especially applicable in real life on an incredibly broad scale, with really no limit on demographics or needs. This project was **InterTravel**, a social media site to help users prepare for their trips. Features included: Activity Planner (activities), lodign listings (hotels), packing portal (packing items for the trip), cuisine chronicles (restaurants), fair fares (flights), budget brilliance (budgeting), wellness waypoints (being healthy and safe on your trip, hospitals).\n",

    "- **Gained valuable feedback** that will help refine **ClubHub** further.\n",
    "- **Helped my peers improve their projects** through constructive advice and troubleshooting.\n",
    "- **Strengthened my ability to think critically about UI/UX and user experience**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the event was **a great success**, and I’m looking forward to applying what I learned to future projects. **ClubHub has a lot of potential, and I’m excited to continue improving it**, and contributing in some way to other people's projects as well."
