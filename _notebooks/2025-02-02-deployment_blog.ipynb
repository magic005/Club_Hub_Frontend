    "\n",
    "Deploying a social media website is essential for making it accessible to users beyond a developerâ€™s local machine. Unlike running on localhost, deployment essential expands the user base web application meaning more people can access it. A deployed backend ensures the database can handle multiple users simultaneously, while cloud-based hosting enables scalability to support growing traffic. Additionally, deployment provides security features like HTTPS encryption and authentication, protecting user data from unauthorized access. "
